# DigiGate

## Project Overview

This project aims to enhance gate entry and exit management for better security and entry management. By implementing a QR-based system, users will generate unique QR codes upon registration. Admins will scan these codes at entry and exit points, ensuring accurate logs.

## Features

### User Registration
 Students register with their details and upon successful registration, the system generates a QR code linked to each user's profile.

### Admin Interface
The guards use a dedicated interface to scan these QR codes, view user details, and record timestamps for entries and exits. 

### Notification System
The system sends users notifications confirming entries and exits, ensuring real-time updates and accurate entry logs.
